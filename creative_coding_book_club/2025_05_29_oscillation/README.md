### 4. Jam!!!
Play around with the examples or code something of your own!

Prompts you can use if you want to:
1. Make sound visualisation using central composition.
2. Design a sound to introduce a new planet in a sci-fi movie.
3. Design a background sound for a wiggly space bug animation.
4. Summer morning in a campsite with a herd of super cute hopping bunnies.

### 5. Examples of sketches using oscillation in different contexts:
